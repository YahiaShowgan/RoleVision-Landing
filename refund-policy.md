## 1. Overview

At RoleVision, we strive to provide excellent service. This Refund Policy explains our approach to refunds for paid subscriptions.

## 2. Free Plan

The Free Plan is provided at no cost and does not involve any payment. No refunds are applicable.

## 3. Paid Plans (Premium & Pro)

### 3.1 Refund Eligibility

We offer refunds under the following conditions:

**7-Day Money-Back Guarantee**
- If you purchase a Premium or Pro plan and are not satisfied with the service, you may request a full refund within 7 days of your initial purchase.
- This applies to first-time purchases only.

**Technical Issues**
- If the Extension experiences significant technical issues that prevent you from using core features, and we are unable to resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe, you may be eligible for a prorated refund.

### 3.2 Non-Refundable Situations

Refunds will NOT be provided in the following cases:

- Requests made more than 7 days after purchase
- Partial refunds for unused quota or unused portions of a subscription period
- Refunds after you have consumed a significant portion of your monthly quota (e.g., used 150+ analyses on the Premium plan)
- Violations of our Terms of Service
- Subscription renewals (you must cancel before the renewal date)
- Change of mind after the 7-day window
- Incompatibility with your specific use case that was not due to a defect in the service
- Failure to cancel before auto-renewal

### 3.3 Subscription Cancellation

- You can cancel your subscription at any time before the next renewal date
- Cancellation prevents future charges but does not provide a refund for the current period
- You will retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing period

## 6. Prorated Refunds

Prorated refunds are generally not provided except in cases of:
